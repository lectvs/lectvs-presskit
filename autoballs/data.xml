  <description>Auto Balls is a chaotic, online auto-battler where you smash balls into each other! Build and upgrade your squad and face other players' squads in the arena! Can you adapt fast enough to survive and win 8 rounds?</description>

  <history>In 2021, a group of friends got together for a weekend and forced each other to make games of their choosing, and from this impromptu game jam, Auto Balls was born! In January 2022, Auto Balls 1.0 was released. In the months following release, it saw explosive player growth and quickly met member milestones on the official Discord server, leading to consistent content updates with new balls, items, a mobile port, and Versus Mode!</history>
